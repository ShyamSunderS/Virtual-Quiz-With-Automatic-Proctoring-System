# Virtual-Quiz-With-Automatic-Proctoring-System

This a is virtual quiz web app developed using streamlit, where
proctoring also automatically takes place side by side. The main 
feature to be mentioned about this project is that this is based
OpenCv, therefore the questions are popped in front of the 
screen only when the camera is turned on. Also as the name of the 
project suggests the quiz is virtual therefore, one has to select
the answer in front of the screen virtually. This means that with
the help of OpenCv the hand will be detected and using the fingers
one has to point out to the desired answer. In this way, during the
whole duration of the test the user need not use the keyboard 
and at the same time proctoring of the following factors
will be conducted and if any one of the factors lack then their 
screenshot will be saved accordingly.

### 1: Human's Presence detection
    Here, the camera will check if there is anyone present in front
    of the camera or not.

### 2: Multiple person detection
    Here, checking will be done to ensure not more than one person 
    is present in front of the camera.

### 3: Face Angle detection
    It check where exactly the person is looking and takes 
    screenshots until and unless the person is only looking 
    straight in front of the camera.

### 4: Speech detection
    This ensures that the person in front of the camera is not 
    speaking.

### 5: Keypress detection
    This ensures that during the whole duration of the examination
    the user is not clicking on any of the keyboard button.
